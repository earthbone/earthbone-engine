# soe-bench: performance harness

Commands, scenarios and timing budgets are documented in
[performance.md](performance.md) and [performance-limits.md](performance-limits.md).

The stress runner captures a `soe_trace::WorkFrame` around each measured
step and prints the maximum count per operation for each sample window as
`work_peak_<operation> <count> count`. Setup, warm-up and reports are excluded.
Nested Game ticks enter the same window. Fixed `prf_14_` tests run the existing
PRF-07 world with 1,000 travel and sandbox actors, ten warm-up ticks and
120 measured ticks, plus the mixed
fixture with 16 actors, scripts and paths. They check every operation against
fixed limits without elapsed-time assertions and verify the fixture's actor
movement and script completion. The scenarios follow local
`godotwind/docs/systems/benchmarking.md` guidance on fixed workload and
separate setup.
