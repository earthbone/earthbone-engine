//! Every named save section, one list per level. A row that adds saved
//! state appends one entry to the list for the level that owns the
//! state, and nothing else lives in this file: keep it that way so two
//! branches adding different entries merge cleanly (`.gitattributes`
//! marks this path `merge=union`). Keep each entry on its own single
//! line between the brackets, for example
//! `Section { name: "MAG-39", write: magic::write_summons, read: magic::read_summons },`.
//! The lists skip rustfmt so it never splits an entry across lines.
